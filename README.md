## Kinematic-model-for-forward-and-backward-steering-car

This project involves creating a kinematic model for both a forward and backward steering car, each in a separate model. 
the behavior is simulated using the turtlesim node.

The models are designed to take input from the user in the form of car velocity, steering angle, and simulation time.

The following variables are stored in yaml:

Distance between center of gravity (CG) and front wheel
Distance between center of gravity (CG) and back wheel
